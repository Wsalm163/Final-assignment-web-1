                <h3>Language skills</h3>

                <p>
                    I spent 2 years in eastern Canada (Mainly Quebec) serving as a missionary for my Church. 
                    As such I learned to speak and understand French in both religous and casual settings.
                    Since returning to Alberta I have continued to improve my French language skills in speaking with friends here and in Quebec.
                    A recording of my french language skills is <a href="#francais">below</a>
                    I have also enjoyed watching popular movies in both French and English.
                    During my two years in Eastern Canada, I spoke with many people and learned a great many things about the many cultures there.
                    This lead me to have a greater understanding and appreciation of other cultures.
                    I learned a few phrases in Spanish and can understand simple Spanish (due to the similarities between the two languages)
                    I have plans to learn Spanish more fully through university classes.

                <h3>Hobbies</h3>   
                <img src="images/Puzzle.jpg" alt="A puzzle piece">
                <p>
                    My hobbies include skiing, solving puzzles, lond-distance running and baking. My passion is to create things and to move around physically.
                    I enjoy both separately and together. 
                    I have ran multiple half-marathons and have also spent hours at a time at my desk creating puzzles for 
                    friends or solving ones they have given to me.
                    I believe that my passion for puzzle solving is what leads me to continue to develop my language skills 
                    as learning other language is similar to solving a puzzle.
                    Both of these passions lead me to enjoy being a boy scout in my youth. 
                    Often times we would be presented with a scenario crafted by the youth leaders and would have to decide as a group 
                    what course of action would be suitable given our current supplies. 
                    This type of puzzle solving lead me to pursue the Chief Scout award (The Candian equivalent of Eagle Scout).
                    I have continued in the scouting program in my later years as a youth leader.

                        Bonjour, Je m'appelle Zael Salmon. Je fais des courses a l'universite de Mount Royal. 
                        l'ete passe j'ai epouser ma femme en aout. On habite proche de l'universite.
                        lorsque je fais mes etudes elle travaille pour nous suporter.
                        C'est facile a parler Francais pour moi mais ecrire est un outre affaire.
                        Cest aussi facile pour moi de comprendre le Francais que le parler.
                        J'ecoute beaucoup de mes films preferes en Francais et en Anglais et lire cest aussi facile pour moi.
                    </p>
