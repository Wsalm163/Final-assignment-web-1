                            I worked for a year as a crew member at a local fast food restaurant. 
                            I was trained to use nearly every type of equipment in the building.
                            I was able to prepare anything on the menu, take orders from customers, cook ingredients for the menu items, 
                            serve customers and clean the restaurant.
                            This job helped me to develop skills in customer service, multi-tasking, custodial work, and kitchen safety

                <h3>Education</h3>

                    <li> University                             <img src="images/MRUlogo.jpg" alt="A Commercial tire">
                        <p> I am a current student at Mount Royal University and have been for a few years. 
                            I am a science major and have taken the foundational courses to
                            enroll in most of the other science programs, I have experience working in a lab with hazardous chemicals and samples, I have also enjoyed 
                            programming courses and have had a small exposure to literary arts classes.
                            University experience overall has helped me to learn to work hard and learn difficult concepts on my own.
                            This experience has also helped me to learn to listen intently and ask for help when needed.

                        <p>
                            I graduated with honors from Foothills Composite High School (FCHS), some time ago. 
                            The classes that interested me the most were science courses
                            . I also studied French in High School. 
                            There I learned team work skills nessecary for group work in classes and beyond. 
                            I also learned social skills and time management skills which have been crucial during my university education.
                            Quick learning habits were also something I picked up during my high school education.
